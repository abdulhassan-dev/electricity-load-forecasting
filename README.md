# Electricity Load Forecasting 🔌📈

This project focuses on forecasting electricity load using both synthetic and real-world datasets. It applies core machine learning techniques to predict future load demand, which is vital for smart grid integration and efficient energy distribution.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Time Series Analysis
- Regression Models
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains synthetic and real datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks with full pipeline
- `models/`: Saved trained models
- `results/`: Forecasting output and visualizations

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 👨‍💻 Team
Built by **Abdul Hassan** and **Shanu** as part of an academic + practical exploration of machine learning for energy optimization.
